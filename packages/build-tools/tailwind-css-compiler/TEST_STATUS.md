# Test Infrastructure Status - WIP

## Overview
Complete test infrastructure has been implemented with 57 comprehensive test cases across three layers (unit, integration, end-to-end). The tests are successfully revealing implementation bugs that need to be fixed.

## Current Status: üöß WORK IN PROGRESS

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Vitest framework setup with TypeScript support
- 57 comprehensive test cases across all layers
- Test fixtures with realistic React components
- CLI integration testing with tsx execution
- Coverage reporting configuration
- ES modules compatibility

### ‚ùå Known Failing Tests (Implementation Bugs)

#### AST Parser Issues (5 failing tests)
- Component name extraction from file paths not working correctly
- Template literal className parsing missing conditional classes
- Data attribute condition parsing incomplete

#### Multi-format Output Issues (3 failing tests)
- Vanilla CSS selector transformation not adding media- prefixes
- CSS Modules selector generation inconsistent
- Complex nested selector handling incomplete

#### E2E Compilation Issues (7 failing tests)
- File generation pipeline not creating output files
- Tailwind configuration warnings about missing content
- Custom semantic mappings not being applied

#### CLI Integration Issues (9 failing tests)
- Command-line argument parsing not working
- File output not being generated from CLI
- Configuration file loading incomplete

### üìã Implementation Fixes Needed

1. **Fix ASTParser.extractComponentName()** - Should convert file paths to PascalCase
2. **Fix template literal parsing** - Should extract all static class parts
3. **Fix multi-format selector transformation** - Should add proper prefixes
4. **Fix CLI file generation** - Should actually create CSS output files
5. **Fix data attribute condition parsing** - Should handle complex data- attributes

### üéØ Test Value

The failing tests are providing excellent value by:
- Clearly defining expected behavior through assertions
- Preventing regressions once bugs are fixed
- Serving as executable documentation
- Providing immediate feedback during development

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. Fix implementation bugs revealed by tests
2. Verify all tests pass after fixes
3. Add additional edge case tests as needed
4. Remove this WIP status once implementation is complete
