# E2E Test App - Current Status

**Created:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** ⚠️ In Progress - Structure complete, but using workaround for compilation

## What Works

✅ Directory structure created
✅ Package.json with dependencies
✅ Vite multi-page configuration
✅ TypeScript configuration
✅ Playwright configuration
✅ Test skin sources created (Level 1: Minimal)
✅ React and WC test pages created
✅ Compilation script (using workaround)

## Current Workaround

**Issue:** Direct import of compiler from Node.js fails due to Babel ESM/CJS interop issues.

**Workaround:** Compilation script runs via vitest which handles Babel imports correctly.
- Script: `test/e2e/app/scripts/compile-skins.js`
- Runs: `pnpm test -- compile-demo-skins.test.ts`
- Result: Compiles frosted-simple and toasted-simple demo skins

**Temporary Gap:** The app's own `src/skins/01-minimal/` skin is not yet compiled.
Instead, we'll use the already-working simplified demo skins from `examples/react-demo/`.

## Next Steps to Validate

1. **Copy test video** (or skip for now - pages will load without it)
   ```bash
   # Option: Use placeholder
   touch public/test-video.mp4
   ```

2. **Start dev server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Compilation runs automatically via predev hook
   ```

3. **Test manually**
   - React page: http://localhost:5175/src/react/01-minimal.html
   - WC page: http://localhost:5175/src/wc/01-minimal.html
   - (Will likely have import errors - expected for now)

4. **Run Playwright tests** (once manual validation works)
   ```bash
   pnpm test:e2e
   ```

## Known Issues

1. **Babel ESM Import Issue**
   - `@babel/traverse` default export doesn't work correctly in ESM
   - Needs fix in compiler source files
   - Workaround: Use vitest to run compilation

2. **App Skins Not Compiled**
   - `src/skins/01-minimal/` exists but isn't compiled yet
   - `src/compiled/01-minimal.js` doesn't exist
   - Workaround: Use demo skins from `examples/react-demo/`

3. **Test Video Missing**
   - `public/test-video.mp4` needs to be added
   - Not blocking - can test page loading without it

## Resolution Path

### Short Term (This Session)
- [ ] Start dev server and see what breaks
- [ ] Identify import/path issues
- [ ] Adjust test pages to use demo skins if needed
- [ ] Get at least one page loading successfully

### Medium Term (Next Session)
- [ ] Fix Babel import issues in compiler source
- [ ] Compile app's own minimal skin properly
- [ ] Update WC page to import compiled minimal skin
- [ ] Add test video
- [ ] Run Playwright tests

### Long Term
- [ ] Add more complexity levels (02-05)
- [ ] Full test coverage
- [ ] Archive old E2E structure
- [ ] CI integration

## Lessons Learned So Far

1. **Direct Node.js import of compiler is problematic** - Babel ESM/CJS issues
2. **Vitest handles it correctly** - Good workaround for now
3. **Progressive approach is right** - Start simple, add complexity
4. **Self-contained app structure works well** - Clear organization

## Files Modified This Session

Created:
- `test/e2e/app/` - Entire new app structure
- `test/e2e/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Documentation
- `test/e2e/NEW_E2E_STRUCTURE.md` - Overview

Modified:
- None (all new files)

## Success Criteria (Not Met Yet)

- [ ] `pnpm dev` starts without errors
- [ ] At least one page loads in browser
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Playwright tests can connect to server
- [ ] At least one Playwright test passes

Current progress: **4/5 structure tasks complete, 0/5 validation tasks complete**
