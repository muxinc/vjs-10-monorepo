# TODO

not comprehensive. just the things I'm worried about forgetting

- an seo strategy; after all one page will have a bunch of lang/style combos. One canonical? Good meta/description tags? Idk...
- a kick-ass 404 page
- a11y audit. some of those colors are sus.
- animations
- redirects that respect user preferences
