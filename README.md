Thanks for checking out the project! It's in its early stages and currently a mix of protoyping
and early structure pointing in the direction we want to go with Video.js v10 (so be kind 🙏).

## Get up to speed

- Read the [v10 discussion topic](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/discussions/9035)
- Watch [Heff's recent presentation](https://players.brightcove.net/3737230800001/eyILA5XG7K_default/index.html?videoId=6379311036112)
- More roadmap and architecture docs to come...

## How you can help currently

- Run the React and HTML demos
- Give us feedback in a github issue on:
  - The aesthetics of the player(s)
  - The initial embed code and component structure
  - The general direction
